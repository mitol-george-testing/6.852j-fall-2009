description: "Problem set on distributed algorithms, and algorithm that shows how\
  \ to implement 2-process wait-free consensus using queue objects, determining the\
  \ consensus number of the stack variable type, Herlihy\u2019s universality construction\
  \ for wait-free consensus objects, and the safe agreement protocol used in the BG\
  \ simulation."
